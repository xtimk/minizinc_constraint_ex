# Minizinc models
Set of problems modelled by using minizinc, that can then be solved by using a constraint solver.

# List of problems modelled

## Send More Money
An old classic toy problem. The goal is to find an assignment of each letter into a number (from 1 to 9) in such a way that the following math expression holds:

`SEND + MORE = MONEY`

## Latin square
The classic latin square problem, with numbers instead of letters. Given a N x N, populate the square with numbers from 1 to N in such a way that in each row and column the numbers are all different

## Magic square
Given a N x N, populate the square with numbers from 1 to NxN in such a way that:
 - All numbers are different (e.g. use all numbers from 1 to NxN)
 - The sum of all numbers in the rows and columns and the 2 diagonals must be the same.

## Sudoku
Not much to explain here. Note that this is very similar to the latin square problem.

## Timetable
Given
 - number of courses
 - number of timeslot in a week
 - number of rooms

and given constraints:
 - Courses in conflicts (courses that cannot be run at the same time)
 - Courses availability
 - Timeslots needed for each course (e.g. number of hours per week that each course needs)

Find a valid schedule for the courses over the timeslots.

## Encode generator
The problem is to find an encode for a set of words such that a minimum hamming distance is always granted.

In details, the input of this models consists in:
 - the desired length of each encoded word
 - the number of words that we want to encode
 - the minimum hamming distance that we want between words

## Haplotype inference by pure parsimony
Given a set of genotypes, the problem is to find `H = {set of haplotypes}` such that the genotype set is explained by `H`

## Protein structure prediction
A slightly simplified version of the protein structure prediction problem.

Given a protein as a list of amino acids (only 2 types of amino acids are allowed in this model = {0,1}) predict the shape of the protein in a 2d space.

In general the protein will have a shape that maximize/minimize the energy. We maximize if we consider energy as a positive number and we minimize if we consider energy as a negative number.

Note that the two approaches are totally equivalent.

In our problem we will maximize energy: we add 1 to our energy only if two amino acids are at distance 1 and are both = 1.

## Travel Salesman Problem (TSP)
The classic TSP problem: find an Hamiltonian circuit on a given weighted graph

In the example input i've used some cities near my home.

## Cumulative Task Scheduling
Classic problem of scheduling multiple jobs/tasks. Each task requires a certain time to be completed, and also requires a certain number of resources/employees.

In this model the input is:
 - Set of tasks: for each task you also need to specify how much time (e.g. hours) is needed and how much resources are needed in order to complete the task
 - Total time available (E.g: total hours available)
 - The total resources available (e.g. The total number of employees of the company)

You can also specify some ordering costraints. For example: Task 1 cannot be executed before the Task 2 is completed.

Then this model can solve these problems:
 - find a schedule that minimizes total time needed
 - find a schedule that minimizes total resources needed
 - find a schedule that minimizes a sort of "total cost": `total_time * resources`
